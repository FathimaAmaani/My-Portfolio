      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an ambitious and dedicated Sri Lankan student currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Software Engineering at Lithan Academy (EduCLaaS), fully online. I began my learning journey in April 2024 and have since developed my skills as a full-stack web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have hands-on experience building complete web applications using PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. I have created several projects using this tech stack and even developed a simple weight calculator using Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am actively seeking job opportunities that align with my technical skills and passion. I’m always open to learning new technologies, growing professionally, and contributing to meaningful software projects.

      <h3>North Sussex Judo Cost Calculator (Java)</h3>
      <p>The North Sussex Judo (NSJ) project was developed as part of a module at Lithan Academy for a local judo training company catering to all skill levels. 
        The goal was to create an efficient Java-based application to calculate monthly training costs, including athlete registration, plan selection (Beginner, 
        Intermediate, Elite), private coaching hours, and competition fees.</p>
       <p> As a junior developer at AQ Digital Solutions, I implemented the solution using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and a Greedy Algorithm approach for accurate cost calculation. 
        Developed in IntelliJ IDE with AQDS standards, the system supports weight validation, error handling, and itemized breakdowns of training, tuition, and competition costs—ensuring both reliability and user-friendliness.</p>

        focusing on promoting martial arts, fitness, and self-defense programs. As a junior web developer, 
        I built a responsive, SEO-optimized website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance branding and user engagement.</p>

        <p>Key features include a clean menu bar, class schedules, pricing tables, instructor profiles, 
        and an interactive media gallery with image effects. The site was developed in Visual Studio Code, validated via W3C tools, 
        and version-controlled using Git. Its responsive design ensures compatibility across devices, fulfilling DoBu’s goal for a modern, 
        user-friendly online presence. </p>

      <p>As a UI/UX designer at Brightica Design Agency, I developed a high-fidelity e-commerce website prototype for Boutiqa, 
        an online marketplace connecting sellers and consumers. Designed using Axure RP 10, the prototype supported seller and consumer workflows like registration, 
        product catalog management, search, and checkout.</p>

        <p>The responsive design included dynamic panels, widgets, and adaptive views for realistic interaction. 
        Usability testing with five users revealed a 60% task success rate, leading to refinements such as a simplified registration flow, 
        login options, and enhanced product details. The prototype aligned with Boutiqa’s goal of a user-friendly, accessible interface, 
        with future improvements planned for search and error feedback.</p>

        cloud-based financial services platform for Enomy-Finances, replacing their outdated client-server system. 
        The goal was to modernize mortgage, savings, and investment services with improved accessibility, security, and performance.</p>
        <p>Using Agile SDLC, I gathered requirements via user interviews and workflow analysis. The system included features like real-time currency conversion, 
        investment quote generation, and secure data handling. I designed diagrams (use cases, FSM, DFDs) in Draw.io, and developed a high-fidelity prototype using Axure RP.</p>
        <p>The application stack included HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), Java Spring MVC (backend), and MySQL (database). 
        After five sprints, iterative testing and client feedback helped improve usability, navigation, and security. 
        The final system was responsive, regulation-compliant, and integrated smoothly with Enomy's existing data infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>Used Car Sales Portal (Laravel)</h3>
      <img src="images/project6.jpg" alt="Project Screenshot" >
      <p>ABC Cars Pte Ltd, a company specializing in used car sales, required a dynamic web portal to streamline buying and selling processes for users and administrators. 
        The project aimed to create a secure, user-friendly platform supporting car listings, searches, test drives, bidding, and administrative oversight, aligned with the ISO/IEC 9126-1 quality framework. 
        Risk-Based Testing (RBT) was applied to prioritize high-risk functionalities like security and performance.A fully functional web application was developed using PHP Laravel with Breeze authentication for secure user management as the backend and the
        frontend was Blade templates with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript. Database used was MySQL, managed via phpMyAdmin.
       Tools are Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub for version control, and Spiral SDLC for iterative development. </p>
        <p>As my first solo Laravel project, I used the Spiral SDLC model to iteratively develop and test modules, starting with user registration. 
          Each module was coded, tested (using PHPUnit), and refined to ensure functionality.</p>
          <p>The functionalities are;</p>
            <ol>
              <li>User Account Management</li>

      <p>This Fitness Tracking Web Application, developed for Kastagir Technology Solutions (KTS) Ltd, 
        transformed a basic fitness tracker into a modular, API-driven system. Built with PHP Laravel and Bootstrap, 
        it allows users to calculate BMI, log activities like running or cycling, and track calories burned and weight loss using MET values.
        Users can input data in multiple units (kg/lbs, ft/in, meters), with real-time API integration via RapidAPI for BMI and unit conversions, 
        and offline fallback logic for reliability. The interface is mobile-friendly, responsive, and secure, supporting user login and activity history.</p>
        
       <p>Developed solo using the Agile methodology, this project showcases my growing skills in API integration, 
        modular architecture, and user-focused design. Future upgrades may include diet tracking and weather-based workout suggestions.</p>
